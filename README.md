# Game_of_life
The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton process, in which cells are continuously born and die based on the current state and their neighboring states.the states are governed by certain rules.
These rules, which compare the behavior of the automaton to real life, can be condensed into the following:
  Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
  Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
  All other live cells die in the next generation.
  Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

This Project is made using the python library -Pygame.
